PARAGRAPH ANSWER:
	An API (application program interface) lets one piece of software communicate with another. It does this by taking a request and returning a response. Web APIs that fetch data from the server allow the developer to display, create, update, and delete data. There are also Web APIs that allow you to manipulate data such as audio and video. APIs help the developer more easily add features that otherwise would be hard to implement.
